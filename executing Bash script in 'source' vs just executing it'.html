Executing it  
	$ ./foobar.sh

Source
	$ source foobar  or  $ . foobar

Note: to source it must be a valid shell script and the file can be in current directory or in a directory in $PATH (check $ export for PATH info)


Both sourcing and executing the script will run the commands in the script line by line, as if you typed those commands by hand line by line.

The differences are:
When you execute the script you are opening a new shell, type the commands in the new shell, copy the output back to your current shell, then close the new shell. 

Any changes to environment will take effect only in the new shell and will be lost once the new shell is closed.

When you source the script you are typing the commands in your current shell. 
Any changes to the environment will take effect and stay in your current shell. 

Use source if you want the script to change the environment in your currently running shell.
use execute otherwise.


<b>Example</b></span><span style="font-size:large">
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
# Demonstrates variable behavior in a subshell environment
VAR=10
echo "VAR is" $VAR
echo "x is " $x
echo "y is " $y
(
echo "In the subshell, VAR is still" $VAR
VAR=$(($VAR+5))
echo "The new value of VAR in the subshell is" $VAR
)
echo "Outside of the subshell, VAR is" $VAR
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


tomdom$ x=50
tomdom$ y=300
tomdom$ ./example_sub_shell.sh
VAR is 10
x is 
y is 
In the subshell, VAR is still 10
The new value of VAR in the subshell is 15
Outside of the subshell, VAR is 10

==============================
and if we do the same with 'source'
==============================

tomdom$ source ./example_sub_shell.sh
VAR is 10
x is  50
y is  300
In the subshell, VAR is still 10
The new value of VAR in the subshell is 15
Outside of the subshell, VAR is 10

==============================
we see that x=50 and y=300 is available because 
its the same shell as from where it was run
==============================
