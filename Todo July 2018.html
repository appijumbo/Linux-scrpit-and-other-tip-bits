-----------------
Also I got another call from an agency for a job in Northwich near where I used to live when I was a lad. Again I had to fluff around the 'what have you been doing' ie do you have experience question. I just said self employed, but they interpreted as freelance web dev. So again I'm fluffing my way in. I've got a bad feeling I'm just not ready...  I'll send my CV to someone I know in Liverpool to see if I can get a couple of months as a junior at his company
