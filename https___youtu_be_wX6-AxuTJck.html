I'm a Linux user on a Mac, having used FCPX a lot in the past. Your assertion that Linux editors are not considered professional is just not true. Professionals (wedding videos to TV/film production) do use kdenlive, flowblade, Blender's vse and Lightworks, some BBC departments use Davinci Resolve (via REL/CentOS); all in Linux. True less choice in Linux, but things are changing "The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has teamed up with the Linux Foundation to launch the Academy Software Foundation" <a style="color:#3465A4" href="https://www.aswf.io/#">https://www.aswf.io/#</a> Another miss understanding is when you talk about 'Ubuntu' video editors. In an open source platform, those 'third party' apps are typically front end GUI's. What powers Linux video is the engines which are open source and driven by the industry for example the MLT multimedia framework and ffmpeg are typically used by the editors/ encoders eg Handbrake. Ffmpeg is also often used at the command line as I do myself routinely, eg to convert a batch of files video format. The community wouldn't want Ubuntu (Canonical) to make 'video editors' (they certainly wouldn't either!), they just support the underlying technology eg ffmpeg , that's exactly what the community wants and that's how the ecosystem grows. Moreover you stated mp3 requires a license... err..nope. not since 2012. But its not an issue anyhow because Opus was developed (mp3 is dated tech). That's what your using right now in fact as Google is one of the companies who develop it for YouTube. Ffmpeg , the video/media engine used by Linux distros also comes with the latest encoders including opus direct from the same code base that Google works on. As for Adobe on Linux, ok but personally I'd use DR anyhow, if I were doing high end pro-editing , combined with my own scripts in ffmpeg. Especially as getting a basic Blackmagic pocket 4k would be an obvious choice even if just as a B camera for many even small film companies at just $1.3K. This would give you the full Davinci Resolve license too. <a style="color:#3465A4" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicpocketcinemacamera">https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicpocketcinemacamera</a>  Its good you tried to discuss Linux , but sorry you come across as Windows users that don't understand the Linux ethos and ecosystem very well. You need to explore some more, and 'live' in the Linux system somewhat. Mac is different from Windows, Linux is very different.ï»¿</div></body></html>
